    <h1>Stim with Oliver!</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to Olivers page! Oliver is my son. He is a non verbal 4 year old with mild-moderate autism. He was diagnosed when he was one and a half years old. His favorite things are playing in water, going outside for walks, pizza, fruits, flapping his hands, jumping, and spinning. Im making this page becuase I dont think autism is spoken on enough or normalized yet. I belive we should respect & try to understand everyones diffrences, including people on the spectrum. This page is also for the parents/caregivers of people with autism. Youre not alone, your feelings matter and this is a safe space for you as well. Stay and stim with us a while!
